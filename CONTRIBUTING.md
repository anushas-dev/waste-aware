## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows our style guidelines
2. Update the README.md if needed
3. Your PR should have a clear title and description

5. **Wait for automated checks to pass** - Our automated test build workflow will:
   - Test your code across Node.js 18.x and 20.x versions
   - Run linting checks (warnings won't block the build)
   - Validate that the application builds successfully

### Automated Test Build Workflow

We have an automated workflow that helps maintain build quality:

- **Automated Test Builds**: Runs on every push and PR to test builds across multiple Node.js versions

You can see the status of these checks in the "Actions" tab or as status checks on your PR.

### Common Build Issues and Solutions

**Build Failures:**

- Run `npm run build` locally to test
- Check for missing dependencies in package.json
- Ensure all imports are correct

**Linting Warnings:**

- Run `npm run lint` locally first
- Linting warnings won't block the build but should be addressed
- Follow the existing code style in the project
